Angel Notes
-----------

This is Angel, a 2D prototyping engine based on OpenGL and C++. 

Angel was originally made by a team at Electronic Arts Los Angeles for use 
in a GameJam they were planning for April of 2008. Some people expressed 
interest in using the engine outside of the jam, and so we're providing it 
"as is" to anyone who wants it. 

Angel provides:
	- Actors (game objects with color, shape, responses, attributes, etc.)
	- Texturing with Transparency
	- "Animations" (texture swapping at defined intervals)
	- Rigid-Body Physics
		- A clever programmer can do soft-body physics with it
	- Sound (.wav only)
	- Text Rendering with multiple fonts
	- Particle Systems
	- Some basic AI (state machine and pathfinding)
	- Input from a mouse, keyboard, or XBox 360 controller
		- Binding inputs from a config file
	- Config File Processing
	- Tuning Variables that write out to a config file
	- In-Game Console
	- Logging


(None of these things are horribly complex, but they're the sort of
functionality that can be a pain to get working properly. The idea is to have
a good set of base functionality to start with at the Jam.)

Some things to keep in mind as you explore this code:

1. Angel is not intended as a general-purpose protoyping engine. That doesn't
   mean that it won't be suitable for lots of different things, but our chief
   goal in putting it together is to make it so people could get up and
   running with it as quickly as possible, specifically in a context where you
   only have 48 hours to make something with it. 
2. Angel is designed for experienced engineers. That doesn't mean that it uses
   all sorts of crazy programming techniques or is difficult to use (quite the
   opposite: see #1), but nor does it hold the developer's hand very much. We
   would not recommend it as a teaching tool. 
3. That said, we've taken pains to make the code as plain and readable as
   possible. In some places we've sacrificed efficiency or functionality if it
   would obfuscate the code. 

All typical caveats apply: the code is messy in places, under-commented, 
certain things may be broken. We're still evolving the engine and cleaning it 
up, so any thoughts or recommendations are welcome. 

We've included some sample games to get you started:
	- IntroGame - a set of modular demos that show off specific bits
	  of Angel functionality. Each demo displays the relevant code or
	  config files so if you see something you like, you know right where
	  to find it. We recommend you start here. 
	- ClusterGame - Our original "DemoGame," where every new feature that
	  was added to the engine found itself jammed into a single space.
	  More of a development artifact than a useful point of examination. 
	- StarterGame - A good point for you to start your own game -- it
	  already has all its paths and includes set up properly, and intiates
	  the engine with nothing in the world but a simple grid to help you 
	  place objects.
