<h3>Welcome!</h3>
My name is Chris Haukap, I'm a software engineer in Seattle WA.  
I'm very interested in game development and recently attended Game Jam Vancouver 2009 and had a blast.&nbsp;  I am playing around with some game ideas and have a few projects in the works.  I will try to showcase my 'best works' below, but for a more up to date view of what I've been working on, please visit my <a href="http://www.evilmordekai.com/blog">blog</a>.<br /> <br /></td>

<h3>CryptKeeper</h3>
<p>My current project, a 3D demo in C++ using OpenGL.  
		    My plan is to turn this into a game... i'm getting there :)
			As the player you will attempt to protect your Crypt from graverobbers by installing defenses around your cemetary.  
			The only interactions you may currently take with the demo, is to pause ('p') and then advance frame by frame ('enter').  
			Additionally, you can zoom in ('z') &amp; out ('x') and move around the scene with the arrow keys.

<h3>Tetrix</h3>
<p>My handcrafted Tetris clone: developed with C++ &amp; DirectX 9.  I developed this in 2004 in between shifts at a customer service job
			I've added little improvements here and there (like a 
			<a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">Nullsoft installer</a>! ) but it has largely remained untouched since i first developed it.
		    Please note that this requires the latest DirectX runtime be installed on your machine.<br /> <a href="tetrix/TetrixSetup.exe">Download Tetrix Game</a></p>
