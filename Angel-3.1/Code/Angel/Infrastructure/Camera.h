/** 
 * The Camera class is how you control what your players see at any time. 
 *  It uses the singleton pattern; you can't actually declare a new instance
 *  of a Camera. To access the Camera in your world, use "theCamera" to retrieve
 *  the singleton object. "theCamera" is defined in both C++ and Lua. 
 * 
 * If you're not familiar with the singleton pattern, this paper is a good 
 *  starting point. (Don't be afraid that it's written by Microsoft.)
 * 
 * http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954629.aspx
 * 
 * Camera is an Actor so that you can apply motion to it the same way you would
 *  any other Actor in your world. 
 * 
 * By default the camera is positioned 10 units away from the origin, looking
 *  down the Z-axis (0.0, 0.0, 10.0). The visible world stretches from 
 *  (-13.3, -10) to (13.3, 10).
 * 
 * Whenever the Camera updates its position or the viewport, it broadcasts a 
 *  "CameraChange" Message that you can subscribe to if you need notifications.
