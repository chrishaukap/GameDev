 *  of functionality (baggage) on the Actor class that you wouldn't be using 
 *  in that case. 
 * 
 * The GameManager class is a Renderable, so it will get all the Render and
 *  Update calls that an Actor would receive. You register it with your World 
 *  (via the \c theWorld.SetGameManager function) and can then retrieve it
