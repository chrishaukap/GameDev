///A helper class that manages the tags you can set on Actors
/** 
 * Whenever you call Actor::Tag or Actor::Untag, the Actor manipulates the 
 *  tag collection appropriately for you. The only functions here you should
 *  be thinking about are TagCollection::GetObjectsTagged and 
 *  TagCollection::GetTagList. 
 * 
 * Like the Camera and the World, it uses the singleton pattern; you can't 
 *  actually declare a new instance of a TagCollection. To access tags in 
 *  your world, use "theTagList" to retrieve the singleton object.  
 *  "theTagList" is defined in both C++ and Lua. 
 * 
 * If you're not familiar with the singleton pattern, this paper is a good 
 *  starting point. (Don't be afraid that it's written by Microsoft.)
