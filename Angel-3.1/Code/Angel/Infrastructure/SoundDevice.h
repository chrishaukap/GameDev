///Our (very simple) sound system
/** 
 * Our sound system is pretty much just a light wrapper around FMOD and OpenAL. 
 *  We don't expose all of their functionality, but if you're interested in 
 *  more advanced usage, it shouldn't be hard to expand this class. 
 * 
 * For more information on FMOD: http://www.fmod.org/
 * 
 * For more information on OpenAL: http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/default.aspx
 * 
 * Note that FMOD requires licensing fees if you want to distribute your game
 *  for money. Because we're focused on prototyping, and FMOD supports a 
 *  wide array of sound formats while producing very high quality audio, it's 
 *  the default sound system in Angel. If it doesn't fit your needs for some 
 *  reason, though, no worries. This same interface can play sound through OpenAL,
 *  but only in the Ogg Vorbis format. 
 * 
 * To switch to OpenAL, set the ANGEL_DISABLE_FMOD flag in AngelConfig.h
 *  to 1. 
 * 
 * This class uses the singleton pattern; you can't actually declare a new instance
 *  of a SoundDevice. To access sound in your world, use "theSound" to retrieve
 *  the singleton object. "theSound" is defined in both C++ and Lua. 
 * 
 * If you're not familiar with the singleton pattern, this paper is a good 
 *  starting point. (Don't be afraid that it's written by Microsoft.)
 * 
 * http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms954629.aspx
