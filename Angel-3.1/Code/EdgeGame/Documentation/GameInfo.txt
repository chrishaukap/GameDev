This file should contain: 
    a) A basic setup for how to play your game
    b) Any notes, stories, anecdotes, trials, or tribulations you wish to 
       convey to someone who might one day download your game and not have 
       you there to explain it to them. 

Use the associated Attributions.txt for any assets or code you use that you 
didn't create yourself from scratch. Be VERY careful with licensing. Creative 
Commons is good, but make sure you give attribution. Open source code is also 
OK, but make sure you understand the implications of the license.

Replace any text in this file with your own information. It *will* be copied
to your final distribution directory when you build in Release mode, so if you
still have this placeholder text here, you'll look mighty foolish.

And we wouldn't want that.
