goals for sprint 2 of development
=====================================

* Decision making system (Objetive Selection)
   - Very Objective specific... no upfront work here?
   - just simple decision making for hunger/provisions/weariness/laziness & find
     next nearest arcane school when first one blows up

* Allow for events 
   - (causes interruptions in current objective & an immediate re-evaluation of priorities)
   - Arcane school burned down? (hero has chance to blow up school -- int/perception/alignment/arcane ability)

* Hero camping/resting/healing/using provisions
* eating/resting/regen fatigue (laziness causes more indulgent behavior here)
* Hunting/foraging 
   - takes time, refills provisions, success based off of archery/etc.
   - int/laziness/location/hunger determines when hero hunts
