Adventuring is Difficult

The Prototype
=====================================================

just focus on the AI adventurer.  His over-arching life objective... his AI chosen sub-objectives and paths.
scrolling around the map / representation of world state.
zooming in on our minion at any point in the world (and switching to 2d rendered scene of that area)
  - rendered scene will loosely incorporate the game map's location (terrain, indoors/outdoors, etc.)  
    we want to make it fun and interesting to log in and see what your adventurer/minion is up to.
    
prototype features
-----------------
good/evil minion
simple long-term goal selectable at creation(Kill some uber bad guy.. generally be awesome, etc.) 
a few sub-goals (selectable in game-time)
   
  
things to program:
1) Sub-Goal selection engine
   Given a long-term goal and a list of goals that will assist the player in achieving the long-term goal (to varying degrees), 
   select a sub-goal that will get the avatar closer to achieving the long-term goal.

things to flesh out/design

The Game
=====================================================

players vicariously control a minion (through commands/instructions) in an online persistent world through usage of commands/actions/goals/etc.

   2) assign stat points to:
        strength/agility/precision/perception/intuition/charisma/looks/speed/initiative/motivation/luck
   
   3) assign ambitions/goals
        player chooses from a list of potential life-long goals that their minion will strive to attain.
        the minion determines a few sub-goals that if achieved would put him/her closer to his/her life-long goals.
        Sub-goals can further be divided into sub-sub-goals that become more & more environment/situation dependent.
          examples: 
             survive:  an intelligent minion might do research on safest cities to dwell in and might never enter dark alleys.

             become wealthy:  
             become a King:  a charismatic minion might start engaging in politics.  making friends and performing deeds to spread word of his heroism.
                             a intelligent/cunning (and evil) minion might research polymorphing, shapeshift into the likeness of a living king, murder that king and assume his role.                       
             Have multiple wives:

   5) Diety Aspect
        aspect/attributes of your own Godhood.  ie., God of Death, war, the hearth, sun, moon, etc.  Will unlock/enable certain abilities/skills/spells for your minion througout the game

* player interaction
   1) login and answer your minion's prayers.  The minion will offer up a prayer to the player (the minion's God) asking for advice (a question) or for a favor. 
      - In the case of a question, answers will be multiple choice and can be used to guide nearterm actions of the minion. 
      (if the minion is requesting advice on a pending event and does not receive feedback, AI will take over for any decision making involved in said event)
      - In the case of a favor, the player can spend "God Points" to perform the favor.      

* Acts of God - (activated through use of "God Points")
   player can use "God Points" for a variety of things in the persistant game world to help his minion prosper/grow
   examples:
      Sense powerful artifacts - (powerful magic items are revealed to you on the map.  you can direct your minion to quest for that artifact)
      scry on location - magically gather information on a map location (defenses/army strength/etc.)
      scry on person - locate an individual anywhere in the world through magical means.
      
* possible objective
   1) build up followers/faith to increase your power/influence over the mortal world as you construct your holy site where you will inevitably be reborn to exact your [un]holy plans
