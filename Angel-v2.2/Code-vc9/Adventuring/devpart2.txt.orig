goals for sprint 2 of development
=====================================

* Decision making system (Objetive Selection)
   - Very Objective specific... no upfront work here?
   - just simple decision making for hunger/provisions/weariness/laziness & find
     next nearest arcane school when first one blows up

* Allow for events [done for me by angel]
   - (causes interruptions in current objective & an immediate re-evaluation of priorities)
   - Arcane school burned down? (hero has chance to blow up school -- int/perception/alignment/arcane ability)

* Hero camping/resting/healing/using provisions [done]
* eating/resting/regen fatigue (laziness causes more indulgent behavior here) [done]
* Hunting/foraging [done]
   - takes time, refills provisions, success based off of archery/etc.
   - int/laziness/location/hunger determines when hero hunts  


goals for sprint 3 of development
=======================================
* make detail view accurately reflect what is happening in combat
    - Monsters reflect that they're losing health, monsters can die off/etc.
    - (events fired from game world and responded-to by detail view

* make hero hunt monsters after he's finished researching 

* make some monsters hunt down hero (using TravelTo Objective?)

* construct Terrain grid which describes the terrain in world view.
    - things like: (tree density, water/mountain/hills/desert/plains/forest tile)
    - world view generates terrain based off this grid (no need to be exact) (in the future, won't cross water tiles without boat or waterwalk)
    - 

* once terrain grid describes the adventuring world, detail view can query it for what to draw in detail screen
    - simple scenario: traveling through lightly forested flat terrain.  Picture Hero hiking with travel sack on a trail over flat
                       grassy terrain.  The occasional Tree passes view in foremost background.  Background will be composed of surrounding
                       terrain grid -- see next bullet point
    - complex scenario:  combat engaged when hero was camping for the night in dense Jungle.  Hero is battling monster around a campfire.
                         tent is setup somewhere.  The foreground has tree trunk sillouettes (and underbrush).
                         The foremost background has more underbrush and tree trunks and canopy. 

* detail view background will be composed of important/high visibility elements from the adjacent areas in the world terrain grid.  
      for example, if the heros current grid cell is next to a mountain cell with a wizards tower in it, 
      the background will have mountains and distant wizard's tower.
